      Hello,

    <div class="accent--text" style="padding-top:0px; font-size:18px; font-weight: 300;">
      Welcome to my blog:

    <Entry title="Guitar" :img="require('@/assets/guitar.svg')" link="https://jacobbusfield.github.io/Guitar/">
      A thrown together Karplus-Strong guitar synthesiser based upon the original ActionScipt from Andr√© Michelle and
      blog post by Matthew Rahtz (<a href="http://amid.fish/" target="_blank">amid.fish</a>). Full credit for this
      project must go to them. The code is among of the worst I've written, but hopefully the app itself is interesting
      (Jun 2020).

      A game I made alone for a 24 hour Game Jam event. It is a 2-player local game made using <span
        style="font-weight:bold">Phaser</span> in a time before ES6. As it was made for a game jam, don't expect great
      code
      here! (Dec 2016).
